# kitti2cocojson
A basic tool for converting Kitti object annotations to bbox annotation for LiDAR bird-eye-view object detection in coco JSON format.

ATTENTION: the conversion does not take camera frames and related 2D bounding boxes into account. 

## Kitti Labels
Kitti provides annotation in txt format for every frame. Every line in annotation file represent an object with 15 elements as shown in the this table.

## Sensor Coordinates
Kitti spatial references (even for 3D bounding boxes) are all in camera coordinate system. A one dimension CAM2LiDAR transformation would be required if annotations are used within Velodyne pointcloud data. This transformation should take place on "z" axis within camera frame.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run "convert.m". The script will first read the name of frames for "train/test/val" splits and generates a separate annotation JSON file (inside folder "json") for each and every split. Annotation generated by the script follow COCO JSON FORMAT (example below):
